# Memristive reaction diffusion processor

Memristive devices provide interesting option to be used as electronic synapses, connecting even biological cells. It seems to be reasonable to create the analog schematic adopting metaphor of neuron cells with the richness of inhibitory and neuromodulatory mechanisms. The interest in neuromodulatory mechanisms is based on our previous research during [NeuCogAr](https://github.com/research-team/NEUCOGAR) project, that is dedicated to the reimplementation of psycho-emotional states and is based on the model of Hugo Lövheim ["cube of emotion"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6vheim_cube_of_emotion) and neuromodulators: dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline.
