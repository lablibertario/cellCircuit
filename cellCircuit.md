#Cell circuits

##Background

Recently there were some interesting success in the field of biologically [powered circuits](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151207/ncomms10070/pdf/ncomms10070.pdf).

The team from Columbia University managed to power the CMOS circuit with the biological power
of ATP. This should be mentioned that currently only macro model was developed.
This could be estimated as the breaking through in creation of the interface from
the electronic to bio world on the cellular level.

##Our idea

The idea is to minimize the proposed devices to  fit in a eukaryotic cell, to put
electronic circuits inside cells. This electronics could do some extra work that was not originally
done by the biological cell.

For example: we could think of:
- processing some simple computations in a cell
- creating computational cellular network in the living tissue
- creating RLC circuits in a cell for wireless communications in the neuronal axons, that usually have enough
length to place an antenna

Overall this could be visioned as a new direction: in pharmacy as electronic drugs,
brain - computer interface, brain - brain interface, in general: almost any living tissue
to any living tissue electronic interfaces.

##Cross-disciplinarity

This approach is heavily cross-disciplinary, we could introduce several domains:

1. **Chemistry** for the bio-electronics interface
1. **Electronics** for the circuitry and proper technology
1. **Cytology** for the integration of the cellular circuits into a living cell
1. **Neuroscience** for the integration of the cellular circuits into the neurons

##Problems

There could be identified several problems even on the stage of preliminary analysis:

1. The energy consumption of the electronic schema could be too exhausting for the living cell, this could be possibly mitigated in neurons via help of astrocytes that could provide increased glucose from the blood stream.
1. There could be a problem in placement of the antenna in an axon.
1. There could be problem in minimization of the bio-electrical adapter to nano-sizes. 


##Practical use

We could identify several domains that could make use of this novel approach:

1. **Electronic pharmacy**: the drugs could be electronic circuits that could be delivered to cells and do some smart curing processes: count number of centrioles in a cell if the number exceeds normal level (this is the characteristic of cancer cell), destroy it.
1. **Computing living tissue** this technology could do some information processing for example inside someones skin. We could think of computing plants, even bacteria colonies.
1. **Natural neural network or brain to computer interface** the cellular circuits could be connected in some complex device with option to communicate wireless that could be used as gateway to the brain providing the option to brain -- brain interface, brain -- cloud interface or even used to communicate with external robotic devices like prosthesis exoskeletons etc. This gateway device could be naturally grown in the brain.

###Implantable(s)

I have discussed the proposal (and the referenced paper) with a colleague who is an expert in sensor technologies and app development - his comment may be summarised as follows:

From what I’ve read there’s been a lot of interest in the last few years related to how best to interface electronics to bodily systems. Apparently it’s (as you’d expect) quite difficult given the nervous system is electrochemical and silicon chips are electrical. So on that basis power harvesting from bodily systems should also be important. And I can see why you’d take an interest in it as implantable(s) would solve a lot of data gathering issues related to human context.
 
I remember from years ago that ATP is the main source of accessible energy in human cells so it seems a very interesting piece of research. The power output is very low though, so I’m not sure how useful it would be for sending data wirelessly out of the body unless an antenna was very near the skin. However, I seem to remember reading about researchers looking at implantable electronics to correct for physiological problems (maybe, e.g. hand trembling, or to bypass damaged nerves in paralysis or blindness), so the low power potential may not be such an issue for that.

I think the proposed list of interested companies may be increased to include companies who develop and manufacture sensors?

##Solution

###Biocomputers 
 
Biocomputers use biologically derived materials to perform computational functions. A biocomputer consists of a pathway or series of metabolic pathways involving biological materials that are engineered to behave in a certain manner based on the conditions (input) of the system. The resulting pathway of reactions that takes place constitutes an output, which is based on the engineering design of the biocomputer and can be interpreted as a form of computational analysis. Three distinguishable types of biocomputers include biochemical computers, biomechanical computers, and bioelectronic computers.

####Biochemical computers
Biochemical computers use the immense variety of feedback loops that are characteristic of biological chemical reactions to achieve computational functionality. (cite book|last1=Windmiller|first1=Joshua|title=Molecular scale biocomputing : an enzyme logic approach|date=June 2012|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/519217jp#) 
Feedback loops in biological systems take many forms, and many different factors can provide both positive and negative feedback to a particular biochemical process, causing either an increase in chemical output or a decrease in chemical output, respectively. Such factors may include the quantity of catalytic enzymes present, the amount of reactants present, the amount of products present, and the presence of molecules that bind to and thus alter the chemical reactivity of any of the aforementioned factors. Given the nature of these biochemical systems to be regulated through many different mechanisms, one can engineer a chemical pathway comprising a set of molecular components that react to produce one particular product under one set of specific chemical conditions and another particular product under another set of conditions. The presence of the particular product that results from the pathway can serve as a signal, which can be interpreted—along with other chemical signals—as a computational output based upon the starting chemical conditions of the system (the input).

####Biomechanical computers
Biomechanical computers are similar to biochemical computers in that they both perform a specific operation that can be interpreted as a functional computation based upon specific initial conditions which serve as input. They differ, however, in what exactly serves as the output signal. In biochemical computers, the presence or concentration of certain chemicals serves as the output signal. In biomechanical computers, however, the Mechanics|mechanical shape of a specific molecule or set of molecules under a set of initial conditions serves as the output. Biomechanical computers rely on the nature of specific molecules to adopt certain physical configurations under certain chemical conditions. The mechanical, three-dimensional structure of the product of the biomechanical computer is detected and interpreted appropriately as a calculated output.

####Bioelectronic computers
Biocomputers can also be constructed to perform electronic computing. Again, like both biomechanical and biochemical computers, computations are performed by interpreting a specific output that is based upon an initial set of conditions that serve as input. In bioelectronic computers, the measured output is the nature of the electrical conductivity that is observed in the bioelectronic computer.  This output comprises specifically designed biomolecules that conduct electricity in highly specific manners based upon the initial conditions that serve as the input of the bioelectronic system.
