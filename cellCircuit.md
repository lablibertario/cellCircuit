#Cell circuits

##Background

Recently there were some interesting success in the field of biologically [powered circuits](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151207/ncomms10070/pdf/ncomms10070.pdf).

The team from Columbia University managed to power the CMOS circuit with the biological power
of ATP. This should be mentioned that currently only macro model was developed.
This could be estimated as the breaking through in creation of the interface from
the electronic to bio world on the cellular level.

##Our idea

The idea is to minimize the propose approach to put some electronic circuits in the cells
and do some extra work not originally done by the biological cell.

For example: we could think of:
- processing some simple computations in the cell
- creating computational cellular network in the living tissue
- creating RLC circuits in the cell for wireless communications

Overall this could be visioned as a new direction in pharmacy as electronic drugs,
brain - computer interface, brain - brain interface, here brain could be also though as almost
any living tissue.

##Cross-disciplinarity



##Practical use

We could identify several domains that could make use of this novel approach:

1. **Electronic pharmacy**: the drugs could be electronic circuits that could be delivered to the cells and does some smart curing processes, for example count number of centrioles in the cell if the number exceeds normal level (this is the characteristic of cancer cell), destroy it.
1. **Computing living tissue** that could do some information processing for example inside someones skin.
1. **Natural neural network or brain to computer interface** the cellular circuits could be connected in some complex device with option to communicate wireless that could be used as gateway to the brain providing the option to brain -- brain interface, brain -- cloud interface or even used to communicate with external robotic devices like prosthesis exoskeletons etc. This gateway device could be naturally grown in the brain.
