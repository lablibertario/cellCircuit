#Cell circuits

##Background

Recently there were some interesting success in the field of biologically [powered circuits](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151207/ncomms10070/pdf/ncomms10070.pdf).

The team from Columbia University managed to power the CMOS circuit with the biological power
of ATP. This should be mentioned that currently only macro model was developed.
This could be estimated as the breaking through in creation of the interface from
the electronic to bio world on the cellular level.

##Our Idea

The idea is to minimize the propose approach to put some electronic circuits in the cells
and do some extra work not originally done by the biological cell.

For example: we could think of:
- processing some simple computations in the cell
- creating computational cellular network in the living tissue
- creating RLC circuits in the cell for wireless communications
