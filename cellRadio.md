# Cell Radio transmitter project

## Principal schema of the cellular radio transmitter

![Principal schema of cell radio transmitter](HL_cell_radio_transmitter.png)

There are 6 principal components of a radio transmitter to be implemented in a cell that are presented in the table below with the implementation option.

|Sensor |Amplifier 1|Modulator |Oscillator |Amplifier 2|Antenna |
|--     |--         |--        |--         |--         |--      |
|GPCR   |G-protein   |Protein semiconductor |Protein semiconductor |Ca+ |DNA |
| | | | |NO| |
| | | | |Redox signaling | |
| | | | | |Ferritin |

Based on [trasduction pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction) we could propose the pathway we could possibly update to adopt the presented above schema. As the overall goal of the project is to make a cell to transmit significant information in radio frequency range. Currently we are headed to MHz range of radio transmission.
