# Implantable in mammalian brain radio transmitter

![High level implantable memristive cortical column radio trasmitter](HL_implantable_radio.png)

This is radio-transmitting neuron block diagram.
*Connector* - creates the electrical contact with biological neurons (secreting growth factor) via attracting axons and enhances synapses via electrical activity on contacts. 

*Polyaniline memristors* - filter the inbound information flow and via *Metal connector* transmit filtered activity to the *Silicon neurons* layer (see [Memristive brain project](https://github.com/research-team/memristive-brain)). 

The *Silicon neurons* layer implements spike detectors and integrating adder generators transmits encoded spikes to the *Radio transmitter* and later to the *Antenna*. 

We plan to crate the millimeter size device implantable in a brain of mammal.
